# Tic Tac Toe

A beginner's implementation of Tic Tac Toe using [rust language](http://ggez.rs/)
with [ggez](http://ggez.rs/) as a game engine and drawing toolset.

## Usage

You need to [install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html).

Then:

```
cargo run
```

### Winning is fun

We still need to add logic to detect when the game
results in a draw.  But for now, you can experience
the full glory of winning!
